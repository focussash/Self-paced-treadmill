This code is based on, and modified from the following paper: S Song, H Choi and SH Collins, Using force data to self-pace an instrumentedtreadmill and measure self-selected walking speed
Original code github link: https://github.com/smsong/self-paced-treadmill/tree/JNER2020
This code is modified such that it doesn't require a real-time machine and Simulink, instead directly interfacing with QTM software
